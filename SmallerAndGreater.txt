Smaller and Greater
You are given an Array A of size N.

Find for how many elements, there is a strictly smaller element and a strictly greater element.

Input Format

Given only argument A an Array of Integers.
Output Format

Return an Integer X, i.e number of elements.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e6
For Example

Example Input:
    A = [1, 2, 3]

Example Output:
    1

Explanation:
    only 2 have a strictly smaller and strictly greater element, 1 and 3 respectively.


Hint 1:
The task is to find out the number of elements for which both strictly greater and smaller element exist in the array as well.
Can you think of some way in which sorting can help?

Solution Approach:
One of the easiest way to solve this problem is,
Find the smallest element and the greatest element of the array and then
traverse the array and count those elements which are (smallest < A[i] and A[i] < greatest).

ans = 0;
for(int i : A)
{
if(smallest < i and i < greatest)
ans += 1;
}
